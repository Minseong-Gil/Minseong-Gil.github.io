  Hi, I am Minseong Gil, a graduate student in the Integrated M.S./Ph.D. program at Korea University. I conduct research in GPU Architecture at the Computer Architecture and System Software Lab (ComSys), advised by Professor Younho Oh.

  My research focuses on GPU microarchitecture and high-performance GPU computing, particularly in hardware design for computational efficiency and software techniques for optimized GPU execution. I am interested in CUDA programming, GPU execution efficiency, and enhancing GPU microarchitecture to improve AI workload performance.

  For more details about my research and publications, please check out the rest of my website.

          My research focuses on GPU software techniques and microarchitecture improvements, aiming to enhance both execution efficiency and computational capabilities. 
          I explore thread allocation strategies for multi-tenant GPU inference workloads, optimizing resource management to improve performance and scalability. 
          Also, I work on GPU microarchitecture enhancements, designing novel techniques that support advanced numeric formats. 
          My work contributes to more efficient and scalable GPU computing for high-performance and AI workloads.

  #         During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

  #         I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
